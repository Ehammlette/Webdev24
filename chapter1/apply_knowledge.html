        <p>Web designers begin planning activities
        by meeting with key business personnel to 
        ask several important questions to understand 
        the purpose of the website and the goals of 
        the business. If you are a web designer working 
        as a consultant or contractor, you meet with your
        clients to plan the website. If you are a web designer
        providing services within an organization, you meet with 
        decision makers and others who are sponsoring the
        web design project. In either case, you begin by identifying
        the purpose of the website and goals of the business to help
        shape the design and type of website you are developing.</p>
