    <p>Web designers begin planning activities
        by meeting with key business personnel to
        ask several important questions to understand
        the purpose of the website and the goals of
        the business. If you are a web designer working
        as a consultant or contractor, you meet with your
        clients to plan the website. If you are a web designer
        providing services within an organization, you meet with
        decision makers and others who are sponsoring the
        web design project. In either case, you begin by identifying
        the purpose of the website and goals of the business to help
        shape the design and type of website you are developing.</p>
